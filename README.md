# Tic Tac Toe [Flask | SocketIO | PostgresQL | Docker Compose]

My recreation of the classic game of Tic Tac Toe using lightweight Flask framework, PostgreSQL database to store game statistics, SocketIO for two-way connection between the server and the client, Docker Compose and Vanilla JS.
The opponent's moves are implemented using the minimax algorithm and depth constant to manipulate the cleverness of the opponent from completely random to "knows what you are thinking".
The game is stylistically minimalistic but good enough for me.
